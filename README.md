# Java Parallel Race Project

This is a simple project written in Java with Maven for the Advanced Programming Topics subject of the Computing System Engineer major at the UVEG.

It is a race simulator to show the use of threads. Reguister 5 racers who will compete for the glorious first prize!

After registered, a random speed will be assigned to each racer and they will be ready to start.

You also can clean the track to start a new race and exit the program. Happy racing!

To start the project, you can use an IDE such as NetBeans or VSCode with the required dependencies installed. Simply clone this repo and run the project.

The basic functionalities are covered here, such as some exceptions regarding the threads executions. Feel free to experiment and build on top of it :)
